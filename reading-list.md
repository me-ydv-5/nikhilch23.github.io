I love to read books. I hadn't discovered this part of the world until soon. But when I did, it was nothing less than heaven. Here are some from my bucket list:

1. Dan Brown: *The Da Vinci Code*
2. Dan Brown: *Angels and Demons*
3. Yuval Noah Harari: *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*
4. Sidney Sheldon: *If Tomorrow Comes*
