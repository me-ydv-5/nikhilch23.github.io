I love to read books. I hadn't discovered this part of the world until soon. But when I did, it was nothing less than heaven. Here are some from my bucket list:

1. _Dan Brown_:  **The Da Vinci Code**
2. _Dan Brown_:  **Angels and Demons**
3. _Yuval Noah Harari_:  **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind**
4. _Sidney Sheldon_:  **If Tomorrow Comes**
