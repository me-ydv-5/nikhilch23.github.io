				<h2>Summers 2k18</h2>
				<p>Nikhil, 03 August 2018</p>
			</header><p>Bonjour people!</p>

<p>The summers of 2018 really proved for me a golden time when I got to learn a lot of things related to web development. The two and a half months was such a long period of time where I got to meet my friends, attend family functions and learn webd now and then.</p>

<p>So it all started when the seniors in KOSS asked us to make our own blog using jekyll. ‘Jekyll’, I had no idea what it was. I just concluded that it is a static web page generator which helps us build our web page and keep it up and running. But honestly I had no idea where to start from. Having talked to seniors, they asked me to start from scratch. Here I present a proper timeline with how I moved ahead in my summers. I will also link the courses I followed in my learning experience. <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001-india">HTML and CSS</a></p>

<p><strong>10th May to 20th May</strong>: I spent the initial few days learning the basics of HTML: how to build paragraphs, divisions, create a hyperlink, link an image to the webpage. After this I shifted to learning basics of CSS, its designing techniques, and how we can actually beautify our website and make it more lively.</p>

<p>21st May to 30th May: Having made my own web page using HTML and CSS, I then started learning jekyll. It actually impressed me alot, how we can just write a text file and jekyll automatically converts it into a webpage. This reduces a lot of effort in building and desgining pages and helps us as a programmer to focus on important components of a webpage. I finallly hosted the jekyll theme on github and my blog is currently up and runnning.</p>

<p>1st June to 8th June: Having learnt the basics of frontend, I thought of shifting to backend now. I did a course on introduction to relational database on udacity and it gave me a brief knowledge about SQL and how to manage a database, but couldn’t continue much then.</p>

<p>9th June to 15th June: This week I thought of learning certain concepts of OAuth 2.0, how it works, advantages of having a third party authentication, which ultimately forced me to have a basic knowledge of how APIs work and its advantages.</p>

<p>16th June to 30th June: Due to family enagagements, I couldn’t learn much during this time, so I just brushed up my previous knowledge. I revised JAVA, C and leant some basic syntax of JAVAscript,</p>

<p>1st July to 15th July: In the last month, I was fully enaged in database amanagement using SQLalchemy. I found it really fascinating and learnt how we can actually store the data in the backend. I  simultaneously learnt to build a server of my own, followed by flask. using all these concepts, I have build a restaurant menu app which actually conatins a list of restaurnat and menus and we can do the CRUD operations in there(Create, Read, Update, Delete).</p>
