I am a second year under graduate student of the department of Humanities and Social Sciences enrolled in its Economics integrated course(M.Sc.) at [IIT Kharagpur][iitkgp]. I am a freshman in the field of open source and I love to code. I am from Deoghar, Jharkhand and I currently reside in Kharagpur. I am an ex-student of St. Francis School, Deoghar.

I am a core team member of [Kharagpur Open Source Sciety][koss] (KOSS) where we strive to spread the open source culture in the campus as well outside. It is not a society basically. It's a group of similar minded open source enthusuiasts where we sit and discuss random stuffs and how it can be put to use. We organise various workshops on Git, Python, C++ and many other languages throughout the year. The main glory of KOSS over the last few years has been [Kharagpur Winter of Code][kwoc](KWoC) which is a demo of the very famous [Google Summer of Code][gsoc](GSoC). It is held in December and gears us up for the upcoming challenges.

I usually code in python but I am also well versed in C, C++, Java and Javascript. I am also a web development enthusiast and have been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript for the same. You can follow me on [Github][github] where I usually upload most of my codes.

I am also an actor at [Encore: Technology Dramatics Society - ETDS][encore] . In the first year, I had an excellent exposure in street play as well as stage play. It really helped me grow mentally as well as physically. I always grew up seeing people act and here in Kgp I got the opportunity to do that myself. We get to learn a lot from the seniors as well as our batch mates here.

I am more of an outdoor kind of person who loves to play basketball, volleyball and badminton. I love to interact with new people and get to know them. I love to go on long walks at nights; the trees, the winds, they really sooth me. I am a big fan of Game of Thrones as well as F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I am a nature loving person who likes to spend his time out in the open. Feel free to text me anytime or if you want to meet up drop a mail or text me on facebook. I will be ready for all the help possible. Peace!
