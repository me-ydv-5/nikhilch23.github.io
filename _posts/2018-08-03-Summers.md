Bonjour people!

The summers of 2018 really proved for me a golden time when I got to learn a lot of things related to web development. The two and a half months was such a long period of time where I got to meet my friends, attend family functions and learn webd now and then.

So it all started when the seniors in KOSS asked us to make our own blog using jekyll. 'Jekyll', I had no idea what it was. I just concluded that it is a static web page generator which helps us build our web page and keep it up and running. But honestly I had no idea where to start from. having talked to seniors, they asked me to start from scratch. Here I present a proper timeline with how I moved ahead in my summers.
