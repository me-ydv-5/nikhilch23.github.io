Hola everyone!

It's been over a year now at IIT Kharagpur. A lot of experiences and a lot to share. It has been a great learning experience since the day I walked into the campus. 

So it all started in 2015 when the boards were done and I was all set to decide what to do next. Then Kota happened. The days were not that easy initially but the days passed on in the quest of the best future. It was good, it was fun, it was frustrating, it was love. I made some of my best friends there. The best set of teachers I could ever get in the JEE phase of my life. All thanks to Vibrant Academy, Kota, I managed to get into IIT Kharagpur.

The first few days were filled with a lot of confusion. All I could find myself was finding the ways to the main building, TechM and Nalanda. The life revolved between NC and NR of Nalanda. It took a lot of time to get used to these Kgp lingo: Peace, Load, Machaanaa, Makhaanaa, 2.2 and many more. I heard a senior one day in mess telling the mess worker, " Dada, Daal peace hai." And I was like how is the Dal peace? Aaah. Those days. Now I find myself speaking the same and my mom reacting in the same way.

But the seniors were really helpful in those days. Under the guidance of my brother and the co-operative seniors, Kgp seemed to be FAMILY. Luckily, I don't know even today how I got into ENCORE. It has been fun since then. I made some of my first and the coolest friends there. The governors of the society were there always. Since then, I have been a part of a number of productions and it has never failed to amaze me. The stage feel is love.

In the second semester, it was my first expereince of Kshitij and Spring Fest and I would truly say those weekends were dope. I took part in a number inter hall events and was a great learning experinece working with the seniors. I got to be a team member of KOSS where I met an amazing bunch of people. Since the first semester, I wanted to be a part of the team and I got a fine chance. I got to learn a lot of stuff from the seniors as well as batchies here. I know it's just the beginning but I hope to learn a lot more.

On a closing note, I thank every single person in Kgp who has made this place awesome for me. Looking forward for an amazing life in the coming years here at Kgp.


Cheers!
